# CSI4103 Fall 2024 Final Project

## Proposal
What if we could break down stock movements into their core components? Spectral decomposition does just that, analyzing stock price data to identify the underlying factors that drive market trends. By decomposing the covariance matrix into eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can uncover the hidden forces shaping stock behavior and detect patterns that arenâ€™t obvious at first glance. We can find out the heavy hitters and the dark horses. With this information we can perform backtests and determine the accuracy of our decompositions. This approach allows for sharper predictions and smarter investment strategies by understanding what truly moves the market.
